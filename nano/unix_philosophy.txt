The Unix Philosophy 
From The Unix Programming Environment (1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike

Even though Unix systems introduce a number of innocative programs and techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well Instead, what makes 
it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the computer.
