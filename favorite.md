After using all three editors. I enjoyed using Nano overall the best. 
Overall it felt like the easy to navigate over the other two. While I didn't like the lines and how you had to read the whole line it was overall the editor I felt like I picked up the easiest. 
When using emacs I did like the ovearll editing functions better and would probably use that as well but I didn't enjoy the searching features when using it. Vi was confusing to get started with at first but once I started I did like the overall use of the command and insert modes. That made it clear what I was doing and when I was doing it. 
I would say that I liked the search feature the best in Vi. It made the most sense to me. I think after using Vi more, it actually could be my favorite editor with more knowledge. But for now Nano is the easiet for me to use and seems to be the best for my current needs. I think overall it has a better user ability with having the commands most used at the bottom of the screen.
